became a searcher,wanting to find out who I was and what made me unique. My view of myself was changing. I wanted a solid base to start from. I started to resist3 pressure to act in ways that I didn’t like any more,and I was delighted by who I really was. I came to feel much more sure that no one can ever take my place.
　　Each of us holds a unique place in the world. You are special,no matter what others say or what you may think. So forget about being replaced. You can’t be.
